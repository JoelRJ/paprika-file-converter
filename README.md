Use the export-encoded_paprika_to_paprika_json.py file to convert encoded Paprika file (.paprikarecipes file extension) to what I call a Paprika json file. 

Once in json, you can edit it however you like with a text editor/IDE.

To convert it back after making changes, run import-02-paprika_json_to_encoded_paprika.py.

The file names are hard-coded in the Python scripts, so change the file name before running each script.

import-01-starting_json_to_paprika_json.py is used to convert from a very specific json format (example_starting_json.json) to paprika_json format.
